== Sashimono

Sashimono is an experimental build system designed to build and release Java libraries with a minimal amount of build time dependencies.

This is not intended to be a replacement for Maven or Gradle, the goal of Sashimono is just to produce jar files and other Java artifacts in a way that is as secure and reproducible as possible.

Existing build systems can download hundreds of additional dependencies as part of the build process, and any code run during the build process can affect the output.
